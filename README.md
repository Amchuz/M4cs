## Who Am I?

Hey! I'm Max, a 20 year old software developer and QA engineer for [@Reggora](https://github.com/Reggora) working out of Boston. I'm constantly posting repositories and new softwares on GitHub for everybody to use which you can find here!

## What have I created?

**:baby: Babysploit - Penetration Testing Framework for Beginners**

<a href="https://pepy.tech/project/babysploit"><img src="https://pepy.tech/badge/babysploit"></a> <a href="https://github.com/M4cs/BabySploit/stargazers"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/M4cs/BabySploit.svg" atl="Stars"></a>

BabySploit is a penetration testing toolkit aimed at making it easy to learn how to use bigger,
more complicated frameworks like Metasploit.

**:computer: winfetch - CLI System Information Tool for Windows Written in Golang**

Allows you to display system information through your command line without needing to have any hacky bash fixes to run neofetch. 

**:fox_face: Foxify CLI - Firefox Theme Manager**

<a href="https://pepy.tech/project/foxify-cli"><img src="https://pepy.tech/badge/foxify-cli"></a> <a href="https://github.com/M4cs/foxify-cli/stargazers"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/M4cs/foxify-cli"></a>

As of Firefox 57 (the Quantum Update), Mozilla has enabled custom user customization using userChrome.css. This file is found in the chrome folder of your profile and allows you to customize the look of your browser. There is a huge community around this sort of themeing and it can get easy to mess up your theme or lose it when you install a new theme. With Foxify you have the ability to manage your themes for Firefox and apply them dynamically!
