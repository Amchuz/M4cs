# Who I've Been Listening To

This is a small script I made to pull from my last.fm/spotify and display what songs I'm listening to during this current week. I have some plans on adding more features like now playing, top songs, etc.

# Config

```json
{
    "apikey": "LAST FM API KEY",
    "secret": "LAST FM API SECRET",
    "username": "LAST FM USERNAME",
    "password": "LAST FM PASSWORD"
}
```

# Running

Put the [`myartists.py`](https://github.com/M4cs/M4cs/blob/master/myartists.py) file inside of your Username repo on GitHub.

Create a copy of your README somewhere in the repo. Put `{template}` into wherever you want your Spotify info.

Run:

```
python myartists.py
```

Profit!!
